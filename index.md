<!-- self intro -->

Hi! I am currently a software engineer @ Meituan-Dianping. 
My major research interests are to understand, model, and optimize decision-making behaviors of individuals and corporates, with applications in urban systems.
I also have great interests in studying sequential objects such as time series and stochastic processes.

### Blog

I regularly summarize my studies, research ideas, and thoughts in [my blog](https://hanqiu92.github.io/blogs/).
